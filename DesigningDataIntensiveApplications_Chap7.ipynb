    "* ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) establish precise terminology for fault-tolerance mechanisms in databases. It is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction. "

    "* Atomicity describes what happens if a client wants to make several writes, but a fault occurs after some of the writes have been processed. Without *atomicity*, if an error occurs partway through making multiple changes, it’s difficult to know which changes have taken effect and which haven’t. The application could try again, but that risks making the same change twice, leading to duplicate or incorrect data."

    "## 4 - Describe *Consistency*.\n",

    "## 5 - Describe *Isolation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Isolation* ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially. Isolation is the main goal of concurrency control; depending on the method used, the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to other transactions."

    "## 6 - Describe *Durability*.\n",

    "* *Durability* guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure. This usually means that completed transactions (or their effects) are recorded in non-volatile memory."

    "* If two transactions don’t touch the same data, they can safely be run in parallel, because neither depends on the other. Concurrency issues (race conditions) only come into play when one transaction reads data that is concurrently modified by another transaction, or when two transactions try to simultaneously modify the same data."
