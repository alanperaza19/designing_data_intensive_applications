Note, however, that it is not a one-dimensional label that we can attach to a system: it is meaningless to say “X is scalable” or “Y doesn’t scale.” Rather, discussing scalability means considering questions like “If the system grows in a particular way, what are our options for coping with the growth?” and “How can we add computing resources to handle the additional load?”"

    "A:  they can automatically add computing resources when they detect a load increase, whereas other systems are scaled manually (a human analyzes the capacity and decides to add more machines to the system). An elastic system can be useful if load is highly unpredictable, but manually scaled systems are simpler and may have fewer operational surprises."

    "\n",
    "A: Latency and response time are often used synonymously, but they are not the same. The response time is what the client sees: besides the actual time to process the request (the service time), it includes network delays and queueing delays. Latency is the duration that a request is waiting to be handled—during which it is latent, awaiting service."
